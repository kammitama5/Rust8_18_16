# Rust8_18_16
Rust Meetup exercises

I recently joined a Rust group that I decided I'm committing to once a month (for formal meet), because the language
is interesting. This is the first beginner exercise via exercism via a Pair Programming exercise with Ian.
I hope to continue with Rust, and I really need to start reading the documentation, but that will probably be
after completing my C# assignment and some Matlab (ie Rust-lang probably during the week).
